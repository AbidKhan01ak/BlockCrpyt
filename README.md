## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)

### Installation


1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbidKhan01ak/BlockCrpyt.git
   cd BlockCrpyt
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
  npm install
  ```

## Usage

Once the dependencies are installed, follow these steps to start using the application:

### Running the Development Server

  To start the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the frontend at http://localhost:3000.

### Deploying Contracts

Deploy smart contracts using Hardhat:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
```

Replace <network-name> with the target blockchain network (e.g., localhost, rinkeby).

### Running Tests

Run the tests for the smart contracts:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```
This will execute all the test scripts located in the test/ directory.
